# Task Manager for Teresa

This is a task manager application built with React and Vite. The application is designed as a simple client-side tool, where all data is stored locally in the user's browser using `localStorage`.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-teresa.git
   cd task-manager-teresa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or if you are using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder.

### Deployment

For deploying the app, upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server or static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

Here is a demo of the app on production:

## Data Storage

All task data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, meaning the data is persisted locally but is not shared across devices or browsers.
